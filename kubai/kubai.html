<h style="color: crimson;">GREATEST PLAYER TO GRACE THE GAME OF FOOTBALL</h>
    <p>Born in 1985,Cristiano Ronaldo came from a humble background in  Madeira islands found near the shores portugal.He started his career at Sporting Lisbon at a young age.He played for the club until he was 17 years of age where he got his first move to every little boy's dream club ,Manchester united.Here he went on to win multiple accolades including the prestigeous ballon d'or at the age of 24.After his notable accomplishments at United, he got a money move that shook the sporting world to debatably the most successful club in football history, Real madrid.Here he solidified his spot as the G.O.A.T helping the club win four Champion leagues between 2010-2018.Cristiano went on to play juventus and the saudi club Al-Nassir.His career has inspired many to chase their dreams no matter their cicumstance.Personally,looking back at what he has done both as a player and as a person he has taught me that even in fame and wealth one must be kind and help the less fortunate.Cristiano has donated to multiple charities over the yearswhich speaks a lot about his character.At some point in life every kid wanted to emulate his playing style.THe dribbling,his heading and especially his short power every bit of what he does fascinates me.He inspires me to case my dreams and apply the needed work ethic to reach my goals.
